# Description
In this project, I will be analyzing the UCI Heart Disease dataset to develop a classification Machine Learning model able to distinguish between the symptoms of heart disease patients. I  will also build a simple Desktop Graphical User Interface to classify patient data on-demand.

# Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date

# Project Objectives
-Analyze the UCI heart disease image dataset.
-Build ML models for Heart Disease classification based on biological signs.
-Tune your models for best performance.
-Evaluate your machine learning model and record findings.
-Build a GUI for users to deploy the model.
